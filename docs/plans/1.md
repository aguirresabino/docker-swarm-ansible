# Task: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline for PR Testing

**Branch**: `feat/github-actions-ci`  
**Status**: IN_PROGRESS

## Objective
Create a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs tests and linting on every pull request to ensure code quality and prevent broken code from being merged.

## Analysis
### Current State
- [ ] Review existing testing setup (Makefile with test and lint targets)
- [ ] Identify Docker-based testing requirements
- [ ] Analyze current project structure and dependencies
- [ ] Check if any existing CI/CD configuration exists

### Strategy
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow file
- [ ] Use Docker-based approach to match local development environment
- [ ] Run both `make lint` and `make test` commands
- [ ] Ensure pipeline fails on any test/lint failures
- [ ] Consider caching strategies for Docker layers

## Implementation Plan
### Files to Modify/Create
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Update `README.md` with CI/CD section
- Update `docs/ai/conventions.md` with CI/CD workflow details

### Execution Checklist
- [ ] Create branch and setup environment
- [ ] Analyze current Makefile commands for CI integration
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow file
- [ ] Configure Docker-based testing environment
- [ ] Implement lint and test steps
- [ ] Add status checks and failure handling
- [ ] Test workflow with a test PR
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] All quality gates passing

## Completion Criteria
- [ ] All checklist items completed
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully
- [ ] Workflow fails on lint/test failures
- [ ] Workflow passes on clean code
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] `make lint` passes locally
- [ ] `make test` passes locally

## Implementation Notes
- Use the existing Docker Compose setup for consistency
- Leverage the simplified Makefile commands
- Ensure pipeline is fast and efficient
- Add proper error reporting and status badges
